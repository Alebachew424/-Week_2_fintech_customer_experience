it's not working
"Hello, I’m facing a problem with the BOA Mobile app. Every time I enter my phone number and password, the app crashes and shows an error that says “BoaMobile closed because this app has a bug.” I tried updating, reinstalling, and clearing cache, but nothing worked. Please fix this bug in the next update. I really need access to my account. Thank you."
exceptional
BoA Mobile good bank
this is worest app 24/7 loading
This App is not interest for Android phone Please update it .
BoA system is confartable
very nice Abyssinia bank is choice all
"this app, for me , is a waste of time. It doesn't work . I can't even long in, and it really piss me off. FIX THE PROBLEM"
Good service.
the app crush frequently
good
You guys keeps getting worst
"This app is a joke. It crashes more than it works, takes forever to load, and half the features are just decorative at this point. Can’t log in, can’t transfer money, can’t even check my balance without it bugging out. To the developer: Are you actually trying to make this work, or is this some kind of social experiment to test our patience? Did you build this in your sleep? Because it definitely looks like it. If this is your idea of a functional app, maybe consider a different career path🙏"
BoA
but not opening on android
Worst App ever. Totally unreliable. And it didn't work at all for the last 4 months.
amazing
excellent app
excellent
ሞላዬ ከበደ
"this app does no work on Samsung a51, it just gives a preview of the logo"
nice
"i entered incorrect security question by mistake boa app lock pin forever, why is there no other options? ?? i contacted different branchs more then 4times but they didn't able to solve this issue ."
Best app
liking this application good 👍
"This app future is good, but there is problems with apps to reset and activate it, which is difficult even to the branch staffs, and it takes too long times to active at the branch plus most of the time high expected failure of activation after process at the counter and OTP sent not work"
wow
it's really good 👍
Bad app . it stuck when you open and noting WORKS.
"the app isn't working after it asked me the password it starts loading, but it doesn't open"
Best
It keeps showing this pop up to turn off developer options even tho it's off! I had to turn on and then off to make it work! This is a horrible experience and needs a fix asap! Plus kinda slow.

great boa
boa of mobile backing
faster bank of Abissinya
i would have given it a lower if it was possible because it crush so much and it take the bank so long to fix the bug
it just doesn't work...so frustrating
like
it's not work correctly... you must have update it
"the app gets a considerable improvements like language , QR scanner and unlimited transfers survice. but BOA Please do alot on its fastness and convenient when we login and making a transactions."
after i typed in my password it says successfully logged out ...and goes back to the first page
good but they don't update enough don't add new things
very good
thank you
it doesn't work period z slowest mobile banking ever i would rather use *815#
"after activated the application it not allowed to sign , automatically it is turn off In my phone, why ?"
good application
this version is not working for me I cannot even buy card. I cannot send money
"It can't actively on initialization, it says incorrect OTP getting the exact OTP"
always problematic hardly works
considering the fact the bank is huge this app really bad you could do better
best app
"worst app and Bank ever u be ashamed, scammer"
great BoA
best
i have went to the bank so many times because i couldn't make any transaction i can only see my balance nothing else so what is the point of having mobile banking if i can't make any transaction with it please work in that
there is no speed
"For anyone who wants to download it, just don't!!!"
wonderful
all worck
Loved it
Wow
"Edit: New bug, app not letting me type in my otp codes. Shameful Why does this app not allow me to use it while having developer options on? Did y'all consider that I might, perhaps, be an actual developer? Why am I expected to toggle the option on and off just to bank (restarting my phone when I do)? Why is the message labled as somthing that will ""smoothen"" the experience? This is like the most ""security consultant"" thing to implement in an app. Please invest in actual security, not this mess."
Improved to be the best
"Decent, but there problems sometimes it says error When i transfer money but infact it transferred because of this bug i transferred 2 times instead of 1 and also we can't transfer money to others telebirr acc we only can to our self BOE Dev fix this !!!"
BoA Greqt Ethiopian bank.
"The bug is still there,the app crashes every time i try to log in, especially in old phones like my Galaxy A32"
Almost better compared to cbe where it is not qualified for
what awesome apps. it is very simple to use and more much important apps.
Wonderfull app
i can't use this app why?
Worst mobile banking app I ever experienced I was blaming other apps but comparing with this they're too much better!!!! It clashes it takes much longer time to login while loading in short it's a complete of trash
bro the worst app made by human kind!! as a software engineer it make me so sad seeing enterprise as big as BOA make apps like this. it is a disgrace for our country!!
AGA B Girja Miss language of admin Afaan oromo & other Itoophiyaa languages
Good app
"I downloaded the app for the first time while reading other customers reviews and as soon as i installed and opened the app it closes back automatically, what unserious bank, now i uninstalled the app immediately"
It has good features but sometimes it doesn't work...0
Very poor proformance
It's not opening. Really frustrating
Verry Amazing App from all IB
Not working on this days
Thank you BoA
best banking app in the wworld
Nice app and it's easy to use
"please add language in the apps setting(amharic afan oromo, tigniya,and others) sometimes bank to bank transfer is not available through time and even if if it is available not reachable…it is serious issue!"
This is help full i like ittttt
The is not functional at all?
Best bank
Make it easy and convienient to use and perfect for all to high prefrence and choice.

Aadan Axmed Barkhadle
😡😡😡🤬🤬🤬
Horrible customer service and app crashes Horrible!!
I love it
It keeps asking me to turn off developer mode even when dev mode is off. Couldn't use it.
Good🙏
Like to much
Thank you
Perfect
The best of best
I was using this app for long time it amazing user friendly UI but the i can't found for get pin button in the app
Great 👍
Fast and suitable for the customers.
Good app and helpful
"I will give only one star, because it faced with multiple of problems. 1. The app is not as fast as the other banks App, for e.g like CBE 2. The App asks repeatedly to switch off developer options, even if it is switched off. 3. Bank of Abyssinia's services are interesting, but they ignored the issues on the App service. 4. Most customers gave a complain on the App, but no one accept their complain to fix the issue. 5. Lastly, I will not recommend the App unless the issue has been solved ASAP!!"
By assessing this you can tell Abyssinia bank has no idea what mobile banking is ?
It doesn't work at all.
this app is not available
Wow what amazing
love it

Good
It's useless app downgraded.
Why is not letting me access my account. The whole point of this app is for me to gey access to my account without physically being at the bank. I would give it a zero but a one will suffice to get my point accross.
Nice
When are you going to get rid of this and have a real app that works? By far the worst mobile banking app.
አይሰራም ሼም ነው፤
Not that much bad
Fine
The dirtiest application ever seen...
Nic ap
The forest app ever
"I love BoA more than anyone but they are cursed when it comed to mobile banking. Even though this ine is hetter it still s*cks! It will ask me to turn off developer options other wise it won't work! I use CBE, Awash birr, tekebirr, Dashen bank and others but non of them asked me this, why only BoA? Please improve your mobile banking, be competitive!"
Bank of abissena
"Easy and sooo simple to use it, also its easy to stole someones money using the app"
GOOD
The worst banking app ever. Never works!
Poorly functioning app
Very nice
Your system is the worst you should do better😡😡😡😡😡😡
It has been a while since you guys started giving the mobile app service but still couldn't get it to work. I'm sure you know that it doesn't work already but not sure if you're lazy or incompetent to fix it. You are losing business because of this. Complacency will have consequences.
"This is the best app; many features are awesome, but it should work without the need to turn off the developer options. I'm tired of having to constantly switch the developer options off and on. I've been expressing my struggles about this. I have precious settings enabled in the developer options, and to open the App Boa app, I have to turn them off. Please help us, Abyssinia Bank. I hope you can provide an update soon."
"I’m giving this app one star because there are no options below that. My experience has been incredibly frustrating due to the extremely long loading times, and the app even closes automatically at times. People choose mobile banking for its convenience, but this app is far too time-consuming, making it the worst I’ve used. I hope improvements are made to enhance the user experience."
Very unprofessional and mischievous bank in my opinion. I have had several occasions but recently I used Abyssinia Card to withdraw money and it was deducted from my account but despite reporting several times they said they are processing it but I learned yesterday that since it has been 3 months the bank has decided to include it in their income. How absurd. If you can avoid this bank.
It doesn't work on my 2 devices A05 and A34 😡
It's better to say I don't use boa rather than pulling your phone out and opening this app
My attention is very important because it will be the most difficult time for me
"I have a worst experience while using this mobile application through out the year. Most of the time it fails to ""Login"" or automatically closed the app. And also it takes so much loading time (5 minutes +) trying to access the internal services. Sometimes also while transferring within and to other bank also fails. So, BOA please fix your app."
I don't know why but your apps start out great then all of a sudden don't work🤷‍♀️
This application is losing major factions on a daily basis. I can count how many times I have used this app; it is completely useless and disappointing if I am not going to use it in times of need then I don't see the point.
exellent digital transaction of money
The latest update has stopped android 9 phones not to open this App. Never work properly since i started using it.
Great

"Your app doesn't match your bank, the app is disaster, super slow. Please learn something from tele birr app."
Fast and reliable
"The worst app update ever. Why would you include the ""developer option off"" thing here? Why do you care? It is my phone my money, right? That is the reason why I switched to other banks. So either turn it off or everyone will discontinue their business one by one."
Very good
One of the poorest mobile banking system

I'm working a lot of international money.But i can't get direct in Ethiopia because of don't knowing the legal ways of getting money in Ethiopia please can I get and direct deposit with BoA please 🙏🙏🙏?"

"Terrible Bank Experience It’s unbelievable that with all the modern technology, this bank still struggles with even basic transactions. The app constantly crashes, services are limited, and every time I try to transfer money or load Telebirr, there’s a huge delay. I have to wait 5 days for failed transactions to be refunded! Even USSD is unreliable. They’ve put me in embarrassing situations countless times, and customer care never fixes anything. I’ve switched banks, and you should too!"
A painfully slow banking app service. Please don't make it your choice!
Good App
Best app to me
BOA
Abdulkadir
Bad
If it is possible I would gove0 star
Nise mobile bankig
Overall good app but performance needs some improvement also sometimes when using instant other bank transfers it refuses causing to be repeated several times to transfer
Ok
Just make it work please🤣 this is embarrassing for a bank of your size
Update to the simplest way it requires the developer option on and off why this is
"Stop telling me what to do with my phone, BOA. Why does your newly updated app keep asking me to disable the developer options? I’m not slowing down my phone just to use your God damn app. 🤮🤮🤮🤮"
I'm living out of country how may I download and use mobile banking? It asks me the Ethiopia phone number and I can't receive text to confirm because I'm out side the country. So please lete know if I can use while I'm outside the country. Thanks
Worest app

Very easy to use
The App's crash always.. Error.....
This app is incredibly frustrating to use. It’s filled with issues that make it difficult to navigate and complete tasks efficiently. I’ve never encountered such a poorly designed banking application before. It needs significant improvements to enhance user experience. It deserves a vey low rating.
Great UI and seamless UX. I love it!!
That's too good application but try to add more alternatives and futures or possibilitys for your customers
It's easy used to operate program and secured 👍👍
I bought a mobile card on this app but I didn't receive it and it took my money and I didn't get my money back.
Amazing
Great app with great services
Yes active user
Shameful
The worest app ever made i would not recommende for no one
Good application
I like
"How many hours should I wait after transferring money to telebirr, please do something about the transfer delay issue I need my money when ever."
"BOA is unreasonably holding and delaying transactions for more than a day, even transactions within the same bank itself. This is a huge gap that I observed in BOA mobile banking. I didn't experience this kind of challenge while having transactions in other banks' mobile banking platforms. After waiting so long, I called your customer support team and the response they gave me was ""it was the system that holds the transaction & will be released on working days"". This is not totally fair."

It's not working. It needs a big update. Can't you update the app quickly?
"I am Aimohon Joel , It's can be Good for a Better Conversation in Time 🙂"
"Better app than most mobile apps, but why do I have to turn off developer option every time I wanna use the app?? It's annoying."
Bes and freindly app
It doesn't work.
"It say ""The request was not successful. please check device connectivity or try again"" why? One of the bank manager told me it is because of my phone's android version which is 9.1 It is ridiculous! Disappointing"
How to download or screenshot of payment receipt...what kinda worst app ever 🤮🤮🤢

"This is not an appropriate app, i don't know how boa develops this app, i don't expect this much crazy and un confortable app form BOA, I'm soory!!!"
"Shockingly bad! Even when it decides to work, it's painfully slow and frustrating. Such a shame that it has become a stain on an extraordinary bank"
"It crashes frequently. It launches on Android 8.1 but I don't think it actually works on versions less than 10. If so, it shouldn't be available for download by such devices to begin with, like many other finance apps are not. It was so much better three months ago, upgrades should be for the better."
Awesome application. But lately its crashing everytime i opened it.

Is it necessary to switch off developer options every time to use mobile banking?🤔🤔😡😡😡
The previous version is better it doesn't work
"I don't know what is wrong with BOA as a bank in general. It's been going backwards since last year or so. The app is a disaster to use in every possible way. Not stable to log in and very slow to perform transactions, couldn't take a screenshot (or can't even find the pictures even using its save screenshot option). Most of the time, it fails to perform transactions and so on. Simply, it's the worst!"
ok
"Take some note from CBE mobile banking app, it's the best banking app currently take some note and improve ur app . Sometimes u have to learn from the bests 🙌"

Poor network
Not yet completely working this App. i don't know when is it will be working properly! Its Sad!!!
The app does not open sometimes it says coonection issue which i dont have and after it opens it has bugs while using its not smooth to work with please improve it

Corrupted and poor app
When I try to use the application it says 'developer setting should be off' where is the setting to off this play Still doesn't work for me

Always slow and doesn't work on weekends if you are in a rush or a merchant this app is not for you
"It's very difficult to use the user, app,ones dawenload the user can't operate well , no one can help me,"

I have experiance
The App is not working on Android 9.1 at all. It shows an error notification and forcefully closes the app. Must be fixed ASAP.
Crashes very frequently is not stable overall need improvement such a huge bank needs a better app than the current one

The previous application is much better than this one
"Worst app. It is wise to invest money and you can make it like CBE app. Even the incon has no image. My app has better UI than yours. So, please invest more and hire professional developer companies and improve it."

I can't believe that Abyssinia develop this kind of trash app it have a lot of issues 👎👎👎
The new app is very good
It's very good but sometimes isn't work probably
It doesn't work
ጭራሽ አይነፋም
"This is the most stupid app I've seen, why would I turn off developer mode just because you can't make your app secure, this clearly indicates the app has very poor implementation and unskilled developers.. There are a lot of people who need developer option for different reasons. Please for the sake of the bank, fix this thing... Even the most secure international banking apps don't require it. Not to mention the lag and crashes"
The worst mobile banking app
It is not fast
Useless
The app keeps crashing it stops responding while I'm using it or trying to open the app. Now I have to go to the bank in person to do any banking activities. In short it is the worst mobile banking system in Ethiopia

"I can't believe in this day and age, one of the major banks of the country can't seem to understand that having a working mobile payment option is a **MUST** to survive. I have decided to move my accounts to CBE and Awash because of this. Can't be bothered with this useless app."
Is it even working these days? Please check it.
"The app is essentially unusable, it asks to disable developer mode even when it is already disabled and crashes, sometimes it only works with wifi and sometimes only with data, or it crashes just because......."
Please make it functional.
its best app but its don't working in poor connection area so
Please Recover thank you
This app doesn't work
"the app used to run fine, but now it takes like forever to even open the main dashboard and sometimes it just crashes on its own. you guys gotta step it up. we need this app to be way faster"
the underrated app I've ever seen and ur banking system is Soo Idiocracy
It demands to disable developer option.
"It's been two months now, I cannot do any transaction using this app. It's really disappointing. I am using bank of Abyssinia currently because it's the nearest bank to my work place. The bank is turning to the worst bank in the country day by day. They always respond to customers that they are updating their system all year long, I think that's what they train their customer service operators to do."

The app is not good need a few work
"The worst mob app i have ever seen. Slow, uncomfortable and stupid. It is better to learn from the best app (tele birr). The released updates is even worst."
"Unreliable, expensive service. Most of the time, it is not working. Sometimes, it will take more than a day to complete transactions and charges more for this unworthy service. I will not recommend this bank app to anyone."

I'm disappointed with the recent changes to this app. Disabling developer options for functionality seems unnecessary. The previous version offered a more user-friendly experience.
"Worest app, it cannot be downloaded"
😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
slow only some times the wey it is veary nice app
ok yes
It's nice apps
Wow! what a disgrace for BOA. The app barely works. Too slow and always returns error.
Excited by your service

"The worst mobile banking app! It doesn't load (seems like with the perfect WiFi and data connection it still manages to have network issues), when you finally get into the app, it makes it so hard more than it should be to send money."
It is Good to save time 👌👌
"I'm sorry but what kind of stupid developer thinks the app will be faster if we disable ""Developer mode""? I've never seen such degeneracy in my entire life, please get rid of this feature"
What is the purpose or point of not allowing to take a screenshot of the recipe after transferring???

Worst banking app ever
not bad
the app is proactive and a good connections.
I cannot send to cbebirr app. through this app.
not functional
"everytime you uninstall the app you have to reach them out physically. very oldy! if that's one of security layer, they'd check for fraud attempt via app source directly(source:- app store, play store ... etc) implicitly ! we are in 2025, physical presence for every app install is traditional(traditionally very rare)."

"It's a problem solver application, go ahead CBE, I love so much."
It's good but try to make it facilitate for your client
Awesome bank
this app has developed in a very good ways but there are some comments I need to make 1- preventing the screenshot likely not good for someone like me coz I need to make screenshot for quicker evidence. 2-it would be good if you make us to access recent transaction histories for 30 days coz we don't have to go to the Bank's in person to see old transactions or add colander category so user can easily access old transactions through colanders.

"Recently there is big problem when sending to safaricom, telebir, and even to cbebirr wallet could anybody who is responsible fix it, it's very frustrating it's been 5 days and my money hasn't been returned it takes it out of my account but doesn't send it to my mpesa update- they have just corrected it and sent me back the money but still I'm afraid now to send again"

"this app is absolutely fantastic I love it and I enjoying to it ,let us support this foundation together ."
"The CBE app has been highly unreliable in recent weeks. It frequently fails to work properly on both Ethio Telecom and Safaricom networks, whether using Wi-Fi or mobile data. This week, the system was down entirely for extended periods, making it very difficult to access banking services. The app only functions intermittently, and the lack of consistency is frustrating. I hope the issues are addressed soon, and that any non-technical influences are removed from such essential services."

I have using the CBE mobile banking app. and overall i appreciate its Feuteres However i.ve Notticed that when i turn on the Developer options on my divice the App.Stop Functioning prorerly It.Would Be Great If You could look into This issue as l often need to access Developer setting for Otter Application ThankYou For Your attention to This Matter
customer service is bad nothing is good about this bank
It is Amazing Mobile Banking App....But why the screenshot of the receipt doesnt work
fast and simple easy to use 👌
The fastest transferring app I ever had its so reliable
"Funds transferred from the same bank do not reflect in the account, even though a confirmation text message was received."
it's easy and fast
This app don't have self activation only you have to look near cbe branch that's disgusting
hello dearest CBE office personnel make some benefits for those using interest free accounts thanks for your help
wow best application ever
"Am sorry but what does developer mode do to the application ? hack it ? are you sure you are developer or are you stupid, doesnt makes sense,"
the pride of Ethiopian bank 🏦
why the app telling me to turn of developer options please fix it.
i am very happy . i have small prob. after i transfer i cant put the transfer cashe bil to my dic.
amazing apps
All service of Mobile Banking
needs improvement
i miss the old one i couldn't send my mony to other bank..
the app is recently crushing each time you open and try to make transfers...it used to be good. take lessons from the Dashen Super app or ethiotelecom. it is not befitting of your experience and glory. inv3st in making it more friendly and convenient. I am considering leaving CBE for good.
good but these week not oky
well designed! Fixing bugs & two step verification with biometric... simply it's great!
If any developer is reading this please fix the screenshot functionality or at least the download button should work flawlessly without me touching it twenty times.
"it's a great job.but one more thing, it hasn't been placed for transfer to other banks on face like mobile charge card place"

"my first frequent experience of cbe app is critical-time failure such as suspending payment on air for 2-5 days with zero explanation, deducting from sender account without depositing to the receiver act. Another fatal error by the banking company as a whole (not the app itself though) is forced-banking with corporations without consent of employers-users of the corresponding corporations"

"I am not exaggerating when I say that this application is one of the biggest players in the banking industry. It has simplified a lot of things for the user, even if the bank is in his pocket. But my opinion is (1), when we transfer money, there is a word limit on the (Note) at the end. Why can't we write our reason briefly? I don't understand why it is limited. On the other hand, there is no limit on the bank. Could you explain this? (2), when we pay for water, why is the code not mentioned"
in this update why screenshoot is disabled now it's not working
"realy I donot seen like this application ! fast ,safe ande confortable"
Excellent but needed upgrading!
goods app!! pleace update this apps??
"The latest update prevents taking screenshots, which is really annoying! please allow us to take screenshots! we need it for evidence (particularly, in case of transfer failure!)."
Fantastic app! I appreciate it very much
Convenient app
Doesn't work properly. It crashes some many times. commercial bank of Ethiopia not only the application but also sending money to own CBE birr doesn't get your money in your bank account. forcefully you must wait 3-5 days to get your money back to your account. walk up CBE the world is going to decentralized finance.
It crashes multiple times everytime you launch it. Fix it. Edit: crash fixed but screenshots has been disabled. I don't know who thought this was a good idea.
why why u remove screen shoot😡😡
"I fails mid transaction, No screenshot, download don't work, link shared not working bring back the old app this is usless"

you must added dark mode options ❗

"Worst app possible, I don't think it gets worse than this. Least user friendly process to exchange your own money, far too many hurdles you have to get past to make a simple money transfer. Even after getting past all the hurdles you are restricted with a min and I believe a max amount of your own money you have access to, not to mention time restrictions; I wasn't able to access my money past midnight multiple times. You can't change tab to another app, having opened this without it crashing."
I'm a Dashen Bank customer as I know its function and duty. Thanks.
i love it
Amole is the digital mobile application what i prefer.
best mobile banking app👍

disappointed because of option to transfer cash on telebirr is limited for self only.... those and other similar given choices by the bank used us to choose this bank over others! no doubt I will be not preferring this bank with no unique incentives.
everything is perfect
Dashin Bank#1
Not working
Both Amole & Dashen superApp are by far the worst mobile banking apps i have ever came across. if only there is 0 star option
"funny app, so much gymnastics just to be an app for sending and receiving money."
I use this app so many times so i like it
Why did u change the option to transfer to other tellebirr account
It's nice and simple to use app.
Just 👍
Not god its
Regarding Internet banking i really choice a Dashen Bank and I have one recommendation for app developer shall considere the low android level means 4-6 android to adress all types of android users because now a days the current updated app can't support such android.Thanks!!!
ምርጥ
Please the update is refused to be download on my phone tecno f1. Please solve this issue ASAP
"Very poor service, always not responding when ever we need to transfer I rate it 0 !"
The recent update is broken. It diesn't allow to take screen shots (which by it self is not a problem) and the share button of a transaction doesn't work nor it will download the transaction receipt. I know security is especially important for banking systems but such a huge limitations on functionality will not serve the app any good. I guess the super app is the way to go.
It is good but have so much problem ...even it say not compateble to your phone...it not easy for work ..

This app needs many modifications. It takes long time to log in to the account. It is not as fast as CBE. please Update it🙏🙏🙏
"The app is cool, but unlike other banks they don't provide a receipt for mobile banking transactions, which makes it useless for payments that require receipt"
I am glad to customer with you .I have plan to use dube ale and amole.

It was good at first but now the system is very bad.please try to fix it.
Generic error how tofix
Fast and suitable to learn.
"The app is extremely slow, often stuck on the logo. Security is poor, requiring only username/password. This allows unauthorized transactions. A large company like yours needs stronger security, such as two-factor authentication. The app's speed lags significantly compared to others. Numerous updates are needed to improve performance and security. Currently, it's a frustrating and time-wasting experience."
Sometimes it's soo slow

Best App for all users.

"The app suffers from severe performance issues, particularly with response times. The backend seems to have high latency, as the OTP generation and delivery process consistently delays, even after the server acknowledges that it has been sent. API requests frequently fail, returning non-descriptive error messages that lack proper exception handling, making it difficult for users to understand the issue. I know you will gonne say""ehe yedekem hzb teche alteche"", but that it."
"The security, cool, every time OTP!! The UI, let's not talk about the UI, But how the heck it says ""offline mode is not available"" something like that, when I enter more than the max amount to transfer. Fellas i am a web dev, this is bad UX. It needs update on the UX. Will see the UI later."

Very secured app but after the last update it takes long time to start .pls minimize the start time ppl might have no patience to wait more than 30 seconds just for the app to open ..
I don't know why I have been stuck with other mobile banking systems when all I needed was amole... I loved it

"The UI/UX experience is already good, but some minor tweaks in font sizes and color can take it to the top-notch level. Imagine the sheer joy and satisfaction your users will feel when they see the polished and refined interface you've created for them. Don't miss the opportunity to impress them even more with these simple yet impactful changes."

Its nice

The upgraded Amole lite app is nice. I’ve loved it. But #USSD CANNOT BE ADJUSTED FOR NEW CUSTOMERS ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO DO NOT HAVE SMARTPHONES. YOU NEED TO IMPROVE THIS ONE

Awesome
receipt downloading is not avialable in this version
Not reliable!
The last update doesn't work when you chose account to send money on lower Android version
Exchange rate is not real
Good Security
"It's good app but i can not see the history of transactions on the app and also updated one is not good can't send always says, choose account"
Its good
Happy day
"Disabled taking screenshots so there's no way to share payment confirmation screenshot with people. When you think the app couldn't get any worse, somehow these people find a way to do so."
Too technical.
🥰🥰🥰🥰
Fast and secured
Good but it need additional work it is slow in respond
My best
"l am old customer of dashen bank, i started to use this app almost for five month, in those time i didn't saw any negative on this app, its interesting and you can pay and recieve payment easily. from ethiopian banks i give five star its always seek new technology than ever bank."

since i started using this app its speed and reliability is great as well. it incorporates all technologies. I am very impressed with the modern work you are doing with little effort.
"It doesn't work, it keeps saying ""there was a problem submitting your request. Please try again later"" how come banking app service down all the time. It is very irritating."
Excellent quality Applications Dashen bank for ever
Way
This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen they are on maintenance everyother day
Well improved!
Keeps hanging ..
It's exceptional
Dashen Bank Amole Lite essy to use and the connection is fast.

<> መፈክራችው እና ስራችው አይገናኝም ። በጣም የሚያስጠላ app ነው። ቀድሞ ያልዘመና ነው በአጠቃላይ ጊዜ እና ገንዘብ የሚያከስር app ነው ። keep our time unless uses this app
I am very comfortable with the efficiency
"I tried to use this app for long and failed to do so. Initially, I able to use it even though with difficulty (very slow, need of login and logout) now and then. Then i couldn't use it. I tried to reset with one of the Dashen branch bank but failed"
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
Too slow!
a best tecnology appl.
This app no working 1 star
This app works so good. But i don't get it why it never show incoming fund transfer report? Have you notice this?

There is always room for improvement and an opportunity to adopt! keep improving and keep evolving. I would love to see external services provided by the Amole app to utilize and actively operate our banking account. Option to invest in ideas that could build Ethiopian creativity. Yosef ke Dallas
"Even though I am a long-time Dashen Bank admirer, I find this app hard to use compared to other banks' mobile apps. It has a problem refreshing account balance, I needed to log out and login to see the updated account balance. Overall, user friendliness of the app needs a serious upgrade. I will improve my rating once problems are addressed."
"very fast ,secure and simply to use i like amole"
The best of the best app

It is compatible.
It's very good app but always try to open requested update...
please how can i fix my app it keep saying application error i have tried to uninstall and install again nothing has changed please help
"It is too slow application than any one of Ethiopian mobile banking apps. Please make it fast, and its feature beautiful. I am a Dashen Bank Customer and user of this app. Thank you."
Not working sometimes
The best one of the internet banking apps I've come across in Ethiopia. Only thing I would like to see added is the ability to get a receipt after the payment has been payed or transferred. Since it only gives a receipt right at the moment of payment and after that there is no way to get a receipt.

Worst app ever all it does is load and fail plus your customer service on front are not supporting
Best app I used it
Faster secure and best international creadite card is the frist bank ethiopian bank to apply prophational card.

This is nice adds that I like it.

Amazing banking app.
Best app ever

Best easy and secure app thank you
Best app Ever!
"Why not we can pay bill,directly from main account, difficult to transfer repeatedly."
"Aside of some of it's major flows, the worst one yet is that it doesn't give you the full detail of your transaction history. Like the receiver's name and account number. You've to take a screenshot to document it or send it to the receiver as a confirmation."
Good app for use simple and easy

Very good app and secured
This app is so simple to use and secured. But while generating receipt or ደረሰኝ its required additional app XML viewer or PDF conversion app. Why? Can we view the receipt through jpg viewers?
Not too bad
Teribble need a lot of work to improve

Simplify.
"Abel Balcha, and Abel Solomon, sad to say what is annoying is to read your comment about password. Your comments on password tell your limited knowledge about digital security. Both comments goes against strong security policies; It is meant to protect your assets. Don't be careless on it. Reconsider your review. In a way you are telling how secure this app is. I hope Dashen will respond to disqualify your review points. It is just not fair."
good👍
"I really enjoy this app because by doing anything it could remind me and saying you logged in with this app, if is not you contact this number.. So I like it"

Thankz
Why should change password it's not good if ur client forget password it can be exhausted for client
OTP not send on time while processing any transactions by this app.
"It is simple to use, one annoying thing is, it demands you to change passward frequently and then, when we get confused which passward we used last time, it locks you out, if you put wrong passward and then tells to go to your bank, which may be miles away. Please make the frequency of passward change less frequent."
good upp
Five star
It's amazing app use it!
"I really enjoy using the amole app simple and easy. I hope the developers add card management services like change your pin, disable card and so on other than that I enjoy using amole it's great 👍"
I can't update amole lite and when I try to use the old version it can't log on to my account.
It's good and easy to user from any branch. I say Continue ahead

This app is not expected from a bank that says they are pioneer in adapting technology.its user interface is worst than other bank its not intuitive at all .it needs lots of work
Best Application

It`s good.but the transaction fee to other bank is too much
Gaariidha!!!
Good app it is useful for business activities .
Like
Account is locked out without any wrong password retries 3 times. Sending OTP is unnecessary because it has its own username and password.we can not make transfer without having SIM card on hands.if it require SIM card why we not use USSD no need of app instead .it makes discomfort for using
Good and reliable service
"Best app I have ever seen woderfull, always one step ahead."
Good apps
Good application for people needs
What the hell are you doing. How can you release an app update and completely ruin everything. I can even login to begin with. You took it from a 5 to a 1.
comfortable
Really what amazing application whcih easily friendly and convinant more finally I would like to say it alawyas updated and modified many times it lacks consistancy.
This is good app
Best mobile bank in Ethiopia i can access this service through different way. I love it
You have made the app more user friendly and easier to access any informantion. Great work from the developers. 👏👏👏

Why is not working
It's nice app tanks befor.
"It's a good app. I like the summery it gives after every transaction. The problem is its asking me to update, when I try to update, it won't."
It is helpful for my transactions.
Fantastic app
"It is nice app, secure. The problem is, it can not remember accounts I have previously transferred to. I have to manually enter account number every time I want to make transfers. The CBE app remembers previously used accounts. Learn from them."
It's a great app
Bad app
Leading bank good job
"The app is good but It could not syncronize the wallet and the telephone number which is attached to my account. It alerts like ''The Mobile Number is Already registered, Search with customer ID xxxxxxxxxxx''. Try to correct it pls."

Always one step a head
"The update description says ""Now you can send funds to your Telebirr Wallet from your bank account"". But it's not available yet please fix it. It is fixed now Thanks 👍"
"Much better than the Amole app, but still needs some improvements. On the transfer screen, the type of transfers' names are missing. Also some of fonts look faded."
ወድጄዋለው
Best app ❤
Excellent! The improvements are also appreciated. But the fact that the app doesn't have language option is one point that has to be improved.
What I like about Amole is it send otp for every transaction and make your transaction more secure. But it will be more secure if you make otp only via SMS.
The greatest app
very easy to use and added features! keep it up!!! always one step ahead!
Keep your great work. Absolutely wonderful and Secured App. May be the best mobile banking software in the country. If there is 10 stars i will give.
The best mobile banking app ever in banking industry.I can't complain anymore what a good work colleague's. VAMOS
very nice !! And please add telebirr access same!?
"I like the fact that it sends you a SMS message every time your log in to the application. So if a malicious user access my account, I know straight away. This feature is unique. Excellent job Dashen!"
It is the best app
Always one step ahead
Its not god
